# wallstreetbets

The reddit forum [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) (WSB) has been the subject of much media
attention recently.

r/wallstreetbets was recently the focus of the news cycle when the stock for Gamestop (symbol GME, the video game
retailer) went up 1000% in only a few weeks (in late January 2021) from about $40 per share to a 52 week high of $483
per share. GME had been in clear focus of the r/wallstreetbets community for some time starting in late 2020. While a
1000% increase in share price is very uncommon for any stock, many members of WSB proclaimed "I told you so". Currently
the stock price is around $250 per share. As ridiculous, and risky, as it sounds, it would indeed have been very
profitable to "YOLO" one's life savings on GME and "Diamond Hand" the shares. I suppose at this point I should mentions
**I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice**, obviously.

This event caused so much commotion in the markets that the House Committee on Financial Services had a hearing on this
event specifically. The meeting was titled,
[Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfEuNHVPc_k).
I must say, the title of the event was much less formal than I expected and the content within the meeting was
interesting and informative. While it sometimes felt like drinking from a firehose, I highly recommend watching the
roughly 5 hour meeting.

Like most individuals working in tech, I participate in the stock market. Also like most individual investors, I mainly
invest in "large cap stocks" and largely don't participate in the markets as actively as some folks on r/wallstreetbets.

However, r/wallstreetbets remains interesting to me. Clearly some folks are making insane amounts of money placing
absurdly risky trades. This raises some questions. Questions which I believe are testable hypotheses. Ones such ass

* What stocks are r/wallstreetsbets tracking?
* What activity correlates most with stock movement?
* What would a wsb ETF look like and what if you had invested in wsb x years ago?
* Can we predict which stocks will become popular on r/wallstreetsbets given the WSB activity history of the stock?
* Can we build an automated trading bot with WSB?

I'm going to attempt to answer some of these questions in a series of upcoming posts. My goal is to use python,
statistics and machine learning to answer some of these questions.
