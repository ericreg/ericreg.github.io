# About

Hello there. This website is a personal blog. It is a place for me to write down various ideas and thoughts of mine.
So far this is mainly an excuse for me to practice writing, and to store notes and ideas I find useful.

I am formerly a Software Developer now working as a Data Scientist. Most of the posts here will likely be related to
mathematics, statistics, software, machine learning. Please, checkout my posts to the side and leave a comment if
you wish.
